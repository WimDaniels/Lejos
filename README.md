# Lejos
Java Lejos projects
These Lejos java programs are intended to be used with the Lego Mindstorms set. Depending on what kind of robot was built, these programs do different stuff.
Some of the programs are simple tests to learn about the Lejos API. Others are actual projects that only make sense with the actual Mindstorms robot or machine.
Maybe some day I will add the construction details of a robot, if it seems interesting enough to share.
